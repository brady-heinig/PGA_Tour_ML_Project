# PGA_Tour_ML_Project

This project focuses on using PGA Tour player recent performance data to predict whether a player will make the cut at an upcoming tournament. Using data collected from 2015 to 2022, this analysis explores relationships between player statistics from past tournaments and future outcomes, implementing a variety of machine learning techniques to achieve the best predictive performance. We are curious to see if there is a 'hot streak' factor, or if a player can carry their recent success into another tournamnet.

In this repo, you'll find made_cut_modeling.ipynb, which is where the analysis is done. The dataset pga_data.csv is the raw data used in the analyis, and it was obtained from a user named Rob Mulla on Kaggle. You'll also find plots used in the initial EDA process.
